Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) lack the integrated ecosystems of addressing the low-latency task handovers, resource management issues, and centralized incentivization strategies. Digital Twin (DT) aids in capturing the real-time varying resource needs of the vehicles and the communication infrastructure that will regulate the task offloading process and facilitates in incentivizing the vehicular instances. In this manuscript, we establish a digital twin counterpart ( ) of the physical IoV (PIoV) to meet the QoS requirements during dynamic offloading and the time-varying resource supply–demand of computationally intensive applications. We formulate a response delay minimization function which is solved by the proposed DT-driven context-aware dynamic offloading method (CADOM). Furthermore, we use M/M/1/N/FCFS queueing method that combats the drawbacks of handling the simultaneous deadline-based tasks in a volatile environment of PIoV. In addition, we also maximize the utilities of vehicle and RSU service satisfaction by employing a reward-based mechanism for on-demand allocation of resources based on the Stackelberg game, where the DT of vehicle is deemed as a leader and service provider RSUs as a follower. The simulation results establish that the proposed system outpaces the conventional traffic management system by emphasizing the role of in jointly optimizing the overall response latency for different task sizes and also ensure a better utility satisfaction by catering on-demand resource allocation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/GreenEMulto-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/GreenEMulto-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/GreenEMulto-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/GreenEMulto.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="GreenEMulto.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024greenmulto" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Green-EMulTO: A Next Generation Edge-Assisted Multi-Level Traffic Orchestrator for Green Computing in Consumer Autonomous Vehicles</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, Shashank Gupta, Kashish Mahajan, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Owing to its ability of sensing ambient environment, decision control, and actuating the vehicle, the technology is able to enhance vision, improve traffic management, and offer convenience to the consumer autonomous vehicles. These vehicles in green computing environments require accurate obstacle detection (OD) and real-time video analytics to enhance on-road perception for forewarned accidents and pollution-free navigation. However, unforeseen obstacles in high vehicle speeds, adverse environments, etc., cause accidents leading to pollution. In this paper, we propose a Green-EMulTO, an Edge-assisted Multilevel Traffic Orchestrator that recognizes obstacles in low latency. It employs a priority queue for the traffic imaging streams, a bandwidth manager for V2X services, and a lightweight DNN model for fast on-device OD. We also introduce a Synergistic service placement and cost minimization algorithm (SSPCM) based on Lyapunov optimization and Markov approximation. It reduces the response latency by addressing the intrusive dynamics of video and unknown network fluctuations in the autonomous driving environment. This orchestrator is designed to provide a pollution-free environment by reducing road accidents thereby satisfying the green vehicular environmental goals. In addition, we develop an autonomous driving platform using NVIDIA JetRacer AI Pro Kit and Jetson Nano for system-level verification. We have also compared it with the benchmark lightweight models (YOLOV5-nano, YOLOv6-nano, YOLOV7-tiny, YOLOv5-small, YOLOv6-small) on such commercial devices. Green-EMulTO witnessed an improvement of up to 20% in accuracy and the training time was reduced to less than 60%. Hence, this orchestrator improved the real-time inference speed over different autonomous driving environments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/EmployingCrossDomain-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/EmployingCrossDomain-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/EmployingCrossDomain-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/EmployingCrossDomain.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="EmployingCrossDomain.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024ecrossmodel" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Employing cross-domain modelings for robust object detection in dynamic environment of autonomous vehicles</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, Shashank Gupta, Hardik Kathera, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

During the sensory perception of autonomous Vehicles (AV) in the driving environment, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained on the existing large datasets fail to detect the vehicular instances in the real-world driving scenes having sophisticated dynamics. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been effective in generating different domain adaptations under various operational conditions of AVs, however, it lacks key-object preservation during the image-to-image translation process. Moreover, high translation discrepancy has been observed with many existing GAN frameworks when encountered with large and complex domain shifts such as night, rain, fog, etc. resulting in an increased number of false positives during vehicle detection. Motivated by the above challenges, we propose COPGAN, a cycle-object preserving cross-domain GAN framework that generates diverse variations of cross-domain mappings by translating the driving conditions of AV to a desired target domain while preserving the key objects. We fine-tune the COPGAN training with an initial step of key-feature selection so that we realize the instance-aware image translation model. It introduces a cycle-consistency loss to produce instance specific translated images in various domains. As compared to the baseline models that needed a pixel-level identification for preserving the object features, COPGAN requires instance-level annotations that are easier to acquire. We test the robustness of the object detectors SSD, Detectron, and YOLOv5 (SDY) against the synthetically-generated COPGAN images, along with AdaIN images, stylized renderings, and augmented images. The robustness of COPGAN is measured in mean performance degradation for the distorted test set ( at IoU threshold = 50) and relative performance degradation under corruption (rPD). Our empirical outcomes prove a strong generalization capability of the object detectors under the introduced augmentations, weather translations, and AdaIN mix. The experiments and findings at various phases intend to the applicability and scalability of the domain adaptive DNNs to ADAS for attaining a safe environment without human intervention.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragePrecision-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragePrecision-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragePrecision-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragePrecision.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="LeveragePrecision.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024leverageprecision" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Leveraging Precision Agriculture Techniques using UAVs and Emerging Disruptive Technologies</div> <div class="author"> Meghna Raj, NB Harshini, Shashank Gupta, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

There is an increasing usage of UAVs in various fields of civil applications including live tracking, wireless connectivity, distribution of goods, remote sensing, protection and surveillance, precision agriculture, and review of civil infrastructure. UAVs or drones have a tremen- dous potential to provide smart farming with various productive solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies together with UAVs are anticipated to transform agriculture, allowing decision- making in days rather than weeks, offering substantial cost savings and yield increases. These technologies are employed in a number of different ways, from monitoring crop status and amount of moisture in soil in real time to using drones to help with activities such as the application of pesticide spray. Nonethe- less, the employment of such IoT and smart networking technol- ogy, exposes the smart farming ecosystem to cyber security risks and vulnerabilities. This survey gives a detailed understanding of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture (PA). In this survey, we demonstrate a comprehensive analysis on security and privacy in a smart farming scenario. In this complex and dispersed cyber- physical environment, we describe how Blockchain technology along with 5 G in UAVs communication network can dissipate the security issues of the network. The survey addresses possible scenarios for cyber threats and the advancement in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can boost cybersecurity.

Most of the extant research works on deterministic or stochastic channels, which are deemed unrealistic for pro-dynamic Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communications. Semantic communication provides a novel concept of serving high-mobility vehicles with faster vehicular communications by using digital twin (DT) technology. However, the low-latency demand, intermittent connectivity, and signal attenuation in the IoV canyon pose big challenges. To facilitate the efficient functioning of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications, we integrate DT, which is a co-simulation of software such as CARLA, SUMO, python, etc., to improve the semantic communication and quality of service (QoS) of the IoV scenario. Further, we have formulated a vehicular sensing and computation model that incorporates system cost and DT migration cost as their key metrics to evaluate the QoS of the system. We have proposed a pro-dynamic algorithm based on digital-twin deep reinforcement learning (DT-DRL) to decode the QoS maximization problem. Numerical results reveal the superiority of our method by decreasing the cost of the system and improving latency, maintaining the semantic real-time communication in IoV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/FmsEnhancing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/FmsEnhancing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/FmsEnhancing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/FmsEnhancing.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="FmsEnhancing.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024fmsenhancing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FMS: Enhancing Fleet Management Scheme with Long Term Low-Latency V2X Services and Edge-based Video Stream Analytics</div> <div class="author"> Kashish Mahajan, Oshin Rawlley, Shashank Gupta, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The incipient technology of 6G networks has emerged to facilitate ultrareliable and low-latency applications for sustainable smart cities which are infeasible with the existing 4G/5G standards. Therefore, the advanced technologies like machine learning (ML), block chain, and Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing 6G network are leveraged to develop cost-efficient mechanisms to address the issues of excess communication overhead in the present state of the art. Initially, the authors discussed the key vision of 6G communication technologies, its core technologies (such as visible light communication [VLC] and THz), and the existing issues with the existing network generations (such as 5G and 4G). A detailed analysis of benefits, challenges, and applications of blockchain-enabled IoT devices with application verticals like Smart city, smart factory plus, automation, and XR that form the key highlights for 6G wireless communication network is also presented. In addition, the key applications and latest research of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G are discussed facilitating the dynamic spectrum allocation mechanism and mobile edge computing. Lastly, an in-depth study of the existing open issues and challenges in green 6G communication network technology, as well as review of solutions and potential research recommendations are also presented.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/AiEmpoweredVisionbased-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/AiEmpoweredVisionbased-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/AiEmpoweredVisionbased-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/AiEmpoweredVisionbased.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="AiEmpoweredVisionbased.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024aiempoweredvision" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Artificial intelligence-empowered vision-based self driver assistance system for internet of autonomous vehicles</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, and Shashank Gupta </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>2022 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/AiEmpoweredVisionbased.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing have truly advanced in vehicular networks encouraging assessment of real-time traffic conditions using kinetic information of autonomous vehicles with the help of road side units (RSUs). However, regardless of numerous improvements in sensor fusion technologies the existing vision/LIDAR-based systems have found severe difficulties during perception on roads. In addition, the inter-vehicular communications are hampered due to inefficient RSU placement techniques causing high-latency issues during transmission of messages. Therefore, this article presents an AI-driven vision-based self driver assistance system (VSDAS) comprising a joint RSU deployment mechanism that utilizes enhanced memetic architecture-based optimal RSU placement (MARP) method and an object detection model that implements an improved Haar-cascade object detection algorithm for speedy identification of object. We have designed two varieties of genetic algorithm (GA) to solve optimal placement problem of RSUs: genetic architecture-based with random restart hill climbing (GARRH) and the other is MARP for efficient placement of RSUs. After our experimental results, we see that the MARP algorithm shows best possible RSU locations over different generations achieving significantly better fitness scores than the GAHRC and GA ascribing to its local search process. In addition, Haar-cascade achieves better mean average precision than local binary pattern and histogram of oriented gradients by selecting key frames. The experimental outcomes of our model reveals that the proposed enhanced memetic algorithm reduces the transmission delay to a greater extent. Additionally, the outcomes of our investigations on two public datasets (KITTI and Panasonic) showed that our improved algorithm clearly enhances the object detection performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/Padaav-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/Padaav-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/Padaav-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/Padaav.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Padaav.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2023padaav" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">PADAAV: Enhancing Perception Systems using GAN-generated Adversarial Augmented Domains for Autonomous Vehicles</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, and Shashank Gupta </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2023 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Padaav.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In the field of autonomous vehicles (AV), it is crucial for the perceptual systems of the AVs to learn inter-domain adaptations in the absence of paired examples for detecting vehicular instances in unstructured real-world scenarios. One straightforward approach is to train the models directly on labeled synthetic datasets. However, this approach usually fails to achieve generality, owing to the domain bias between the real and fake databases of images. We therefore, propose a novel architecture that produces synthetic images based on cycle consistency, in the absence of labeled pair of images. We test the object detectors Detectron and SSD on four types of curated benchmark datasets to evaluate their robustness in detecting objects such as cars, bikes, and pedestrians on road. The four benchmark datasets contain a diversified set of image corruptions and a few variations are built using the proposed framework such as weather variations. The four datasets are PASCAL VOC and SYNTHIA dataset images, weather-translated images, variation-augmented images, and stylized renderings using Adain style transfer. After conducting extensive investigations, we observe a decreased classification loss when exposed to variable image quality. We also witness that augmenting the training datasets with variations in the wild aided in boosting the generalizing capability of the object detectors. The boost in performance is testified by the testing results showing better mAP.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="ThreeDModellin.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2023computationalapproachbook" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Computational Approach for Regulation of Biomedical Waste Expulsion in a Novel Coronavirus Pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, Yatendra Sahu, Rajeev Kumar, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

In December 2019, the world got word of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus. On January 30, India reported its very first case in Kerala. The person had a travel history from Wuhan, China. Bygone times have also witnessed pandemics in every era. Right from the emergence of the 1720 plague, 1820 cholera, 1920 Spanish Flu, to COVID-2019, the epidemics have dilapidated the very foundation of the world in ways that have caused the very existential basis of humankind to be on crutches. The virus proliferated inevitably in nearby areas of Kerala, having a butterfly effect in continuation. In this situation, the health facilities were to be primed and proper management was required to 66cater to the mass outbreak of the sick. The medical homes showed a surge in contaminated waste expelled from the hospitals. This biomedical waste creates a nuisance to nature and to people trying to manage the biomedical waste produced by hospitals. One aspect of living, that being waste management, has been sparked. This chapter hogs the limelight specifically on the bio-medical waste management that is being produced in the course of COVID-19. With increasing demands and usage of medical equipment, PPEs, etc., health care waste generation shows a surging trend. The sophisticated methods for waste disposal can be used to achieve minimal damage to nature, which is the intention of this chapter. Since the anti-drug for COVID is yet to come, proper management of waste dispensing should be held in priority as it may further invite unprecedented diseases that may cause greater social upheaval. Also, we acknowledge certain positive effects of the coronavirus on nature, which we term ‘Lessons Learnt from Nature’.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragingBigDataAnalytics-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragingBigDataAnalytics-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragingBigDataAnalytics-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/LeveragingBigDataAnalytics.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="LeveragingBigDataAnalytics.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2024leveragingbiddataanalytics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Leveraging big data analytics in 5G-enabled IoT and industrial IoT for the development of sustainable smart cities</div> <div class="author"> Suprakash Mukherjee, Shashank Gupta, Oshin Rawlley, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Moreover, enhanced network capabilities facilitate enabling of IoV technology for latency-critical applications in energy-constrained smart IoT devices. However, IoV networks demand energy efficiency due to its dynamic nature for which Roadside Units (RSUs) are critical. However, in cities, huge deployment of RSUs and their maintenance is expensive in IoV infrastructure, requiring a trade-off between the network coverage and installation-related expenses. Also, the latency issues in IoV are highly dependent on the positioning of accessible RSUs. Motivated by the above highlighted issues, we propose an upgraded RSU placement method to boost network efficiency through placement of RSUs in optimal locations in a given road map. The Memetic Framework-based Optimal RSU Deployment (MFRD) algorithm is proposed to maximize the coverage area among the vehicles in an IoV and minimize the overlap in the coverage of the different RSUs. We observed from simulation results based on real-world maps that MFRD yields a significantly higher fitness score as compared to the existing state-of-the-art in terms of optimal positioning of the RSUs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/UpgradedObjectDetection-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/UpgradedObjectDetection-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/UpgradedObjectDetection-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/UpgradedObjectDetection.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="UpgradedObjectDetection.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2022upgradedobjectdetection" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An Upgraded Object Detection Model for Enhanced Perception and Decision Making in Autonomous Vehicles</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, and Shashank Gupta </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops) on Blockchain for Secure Software-defined Networking in Smart Communities</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/UpgradedObjectDetection.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In Internet of Vehicles (IoV), accurate object detection is one of the basic requirements for Autonomous Vehicles (AV s) and Vision-based Self Driver Assistance System (VSDAS). With restricted processing power of sensor nodes and network bandwidth, enhanced object detection with low energy consumption and acceptable rate of accuracy is still a major issue that makes VSDAS untrust-worthy and unsustainable. Considering this situation, in this paper, the authors propose an upgraded Object Detection model for simulating the enhanced perception and decision making in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three methods namely Histogram of Ori-ented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), HAAR utilizing KITTI dataset. The results reveal that Haar exhibits higher detection rate than the other two methods. For the enhanced object detection, we utilize a frame similarity difference technique for filtering out the duplicate frames and generating key frames. Finally, an upgraded Haar-cascade classification algorithm is proposed for accurate and fast object detection. Our comprehensive experimental outcomes on the eminent publicly available dataset (KITTI) showed that our model not only significantly improves the performance of object detection however, also saves the energy consumption of edee devices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Security and Privacy</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="200px"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/ThreeDModellin.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="ThreeDModellin.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rawlley2022achievingambientintelligence" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Achieving ambient intelligence in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic using fog computing-driven IoT</div> <div class="author"> Oshin Rawlley, and Shashank Gupta </div> <div class="periodical"> 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ThreeDModellin.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this chapter, the authors present a comprehensive review on how the fog computing-based IoT can be utilized for the outbreak prevention and its existing control systems.

Here I have explored the angle of how can we put big data into use. Big data can turn into trash if no significant information can be extracted out. So it needs to be presented &amp; visualized in a manner that visuals can milk out most of it. Already in my previous accepted paper, I have discussed the conventional &amp; novel approaches of data visualization &amp; also the future scope of it. In this paper I am going to work upon the future scope proposed by me in my previous paper i.e. “interactive visualization’’. Only blindly showing a diagram sometimes may not be useful as it doesn’t reveal much of the facts. A proper analyzable pattern or an insight can be concluded if the visuals interact with the user. Also it is important that one should choose the right chart to the data to be analyzed.
