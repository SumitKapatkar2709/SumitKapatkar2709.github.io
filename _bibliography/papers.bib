  abstract={Imaging technology in vehicular communications has advanced in the consumer industry. Owing to its ability of sensing ambient environment, decision control, and actuating the vehicle, the technology is able to enhance vision, improve traffic management, and offer convenience to the consumer autonomous vehicles. These vehicles in green computing environments require accurate obstacle detection (OD) and real-time video analytics to enhance on-road perception for forewarned accidents and pollution-free navigation. However, unforeseen obstacles in high vehicle speeds, adverse environments, etc., cause accidents leading to pollution. In this paper, we propose a Green-EMulTO, an Edge-assisted Multilevel Traffic Orchestrator that recognizes obstacles in low latency. It employs a priority queue for the traffic imaging streams, a bandwidth manager for V2X services, and a lightweight DNN model for fast on-device OD. We also introduce a Synergistic service placement and cost minimization algorithm (SSPCM) based on Lyapunov optimization and Markov approximation. It reduces the response latency by addressing the intrusive dynamics of video and unknown network fluctuations in the autonomous driving environment. This orchestrator is designed to provide a pollution-free environment by reducing road accidents thereby satisfying the green vehicular environmental goals. In addition, we develop an autonomous driving platform using NVIDIA JetRacer AI Pro Kit and Jetson Nano for system-level verification. We have also compared it with the benchmark lightweight models (YOLOV5-nano, YOLOv6-nano, YOLOV7-tiny, YOLOv5-small, YOLOv6-small) on such commercial devices. Green-EMulTO witnessed an improvement of up to 20% in accuracy and the training time was reduced to less than 60%. Hence, this orchestrator improved the real-time inference speed over different autonomous driving environments.},

  abstract={Object detection (OD) in Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) has been a fundamental problem especially when complex unseen cross-domain adaptations occur in real driving scenarios of autonomous Vehicles (AVs). During the sensory perception of autonomous Vehicles (AV) in the driving environment, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained on the existing large datasets fail to detect the vehicular instances in the real-world driving scenes having sophisticated dynamics. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been effective in generating different domain adaptations under various operational conditions of AVs, however, it lacks key-object preservation during the image-to-image translation process. Moreover, high translation discrepancy has been observed with many existing GAN frameworks when encountered with large and complex domain shifts such as night, rain, fog, etc. resulting in an increased number of false positives during vehicle detection. Motivated by the above challenges, we propose COPGAN, a cycle-object preserving cross-domain GAN framework that generates diverse variations of cross-domain mappings by translating the driving conditions of AV to a desired target domain while preserving the key objects. We fine-tune the COPGAN training with an initial step of key-feature selection so that we realize the instance-aware image translation model. It introduces a cycle-consistency loss to produce instance specific translated images in various domains. As compared to the baseline models that needed a pixel-level identification for preserving the object features, COPGAN requires instance-level annotations that are easier to acquire. We test the robustness of the object detectors SSD, Detectron, and YOLOv5 (SDY) against the synthetically-generated COPGAN images, along with AdaIN images, stylized renderings, and augmented images. The robustness of COPGAN is measured in mean performance degradation for the distorted test set ( at IoU threshold = 50) and relative performance degradation under corruption (rPD). Our empirical outcomes prove a strong generalization capability of the object detectors under the introduced augmentations, weather translations, and AdaIN mix. The experiments and findings at various phases intend to the applicability and scalability of the domain adaptive DNNs to ADAS for attaining a safe environment without human intervention.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
